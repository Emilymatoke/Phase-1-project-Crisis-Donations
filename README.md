PHASE 1 PROJECT- CRISIS DONATIONS


Author: Emily Matoke


Project Introduction.

Even with the nation's economic growth during the last ten years, two thirds of Kenyans are impoverished. Given the alarmingly high levels of food insecurity caused by the climate crisis, it is more important than ever to prevent and manage hunger in Kenya. Massive obstacles that communities must overcome include widespread livestock losses brought on by protracted drought, intense flooding, poor crops, starvation, and poverty.

Solution

In order to address this, my project will list the areas of Kenya where hunger is most prevalent and will ask users to donate so that these at-risk children can eat. 


As a user, I can:

    Add a County to the existing counties.
    Delete an existing county from the list of counties.
    Make a donation.
